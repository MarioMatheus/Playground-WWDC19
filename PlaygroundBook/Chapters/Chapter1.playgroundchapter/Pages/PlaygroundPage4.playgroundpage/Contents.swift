//: ## The Hearing
//: The shark is already managing to eat better. If he is still having difficulty feeding,
//: he has a more powerful sense, that is, the strength of a shark goes well beyond what
//: has already been presented, this time we will approach his hearing.
//:
//: ###
//: - Important:
//: Sharks have small holes at the top of the head, connected to semicircular inner canals
//: that accurately detect underwater sounds like a fish cracking up to 1500m away.
//:
//: ###
//: ## Adding Hearing
//: Your hearing as well as your sense of smell is one of the main senses used by sharks to search for food,
//: with which your shark can hear the fish that are making noise.

//:
//: - Note:
//: The hearing is represented by a yellow border circle, if a fish is playing a French Horn and
//: enters the hearing field of shark, this will follow the noise to stop the sound and will take
//: the opportunity to snack.
