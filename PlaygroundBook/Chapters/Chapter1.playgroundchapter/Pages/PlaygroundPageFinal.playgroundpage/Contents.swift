//: ## About Me
//: ![Me](me_2.png)
//: Hi, I'm Mario Matheus, student of computer engineering at the Federal Institute of Ceará and
//: scolarship student of Apple Developer Academy IFCE.
//: I love sharks, I love games, I love artificial intelligence, I love pixel art, I love programming.
//: I decided to build this book to interconnect the things I love and build a way to share these things,
//: especially the powerful sharks, fantastic animals, kings of the seas.
//:
//: I hope this book has served your purpose, that you have learned a little from the Thresher Shark
//: and have been amused and admired by your intelligence and power. May this book help you see sharks
//: with other eyes and not as human devouring villains, and so preserve the species.
